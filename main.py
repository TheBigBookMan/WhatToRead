#* library book system that will have a book database

#* use SQLLite or MYSQL database and Python as the backend

# * Make it a full stack application for book inquiries with react front end and python backend--- maybe use Django!?!??!

#* use graphql as API MAYBEEE



#* use randomisers to seed data with X amount in stock

# * use a third party api to get book info

# * have a checkout system as well based on user authentication

# * might be able to use JWT for authorization but will have to check or use something else (explore around what other authorization methods there are)

# * user login to use the application

#* can add a favouriting/review system for users so they can see what other people think of the books they are browsing

#* use ascii logo for the thing and the console.table for how it should show the information

#* browse around  packages for interesting things that may help or make it even better
